# Coding Kata 1

## Factory

I chose this design patter because looking at the previous Random class I had, it wouldnt support a lot of changes and looked very messy.
Using the factory pattern, I can inject different enemy factories to change enemy creation without needing to rewrite a whole class.
It also helps me seperate the creaton logic from the game.
